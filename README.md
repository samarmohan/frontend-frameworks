# 🚩 Frontend Frameworks 🚩

---

### 🚀 About 🚀

I created the same todo list frontend using three different technologies: React, Vue, Angular.
These are all for educational purposes. They do not accomplish any specific task. <br>

They fetch from the same API, which is [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

### ⚡ Status ⚡

Nothing has been deployed yet. I believe this is done and I will not be working on it frequently.

### 🌍 Contributing 🌍

Only submit issues if there is an inconsistency between frontends or if there is a serious security issue.
Feel free to submit PRs if you fixed something I didn't know about! You can also submit a PR with a whole new frontend like Svelte!
