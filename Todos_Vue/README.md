# React vs Vue vs Angular

### What is this?

I built three identical todo lists using Vue, Angular, and React. They use the same styling, fetch data from the same [api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), have the same functionality, and the same pages. The only differences are the title and the about page.

### How to use this

You can clone the repo and mess around with the code or you can just browse the GitHub code.

### Contributing
